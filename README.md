## 🧠 Project Overview

Gifterly is a seasonal gift exchange tradition where each participant is randomly assigned another person to give a gift — without anyone knowing who gets whom.

This web app provides a frontend UI that:

- Allows users to add a list of names
- Generates Gifterly assignments randomly
- Ensures no one is assigned to themselves (basic pairing logic)
- Displays the generated pairings clearly

It’s a simple but interactive React project that demonstrates frontend logic, state management, and user interaction.
